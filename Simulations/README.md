# Simulations / Scenarios

Add your scenario code here. This code is compiled appart from the simulation code: you just need the header files of the project and its shared library of the simulator.

When compiling your scenario, it will create a shred library that can be passed to the command line of the simulator: it will load it.
Shared library is currently the most easy way to create shareable simulation files without needed the help of any scripting langage.
