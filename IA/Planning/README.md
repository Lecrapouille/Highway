# Prolog code for planning ego car to parking slot

The idea is to use Prolog to avoid implementing hierachical state machine to make a ego car self driving inside
a parking to find an empty parking slot. Can we, from the camera point of view of the ego car, with Prolog clauses
describing the image (such as "I detect a pedestiran") can achieve robust state machine doing action such as "find
the parking slot the closest from the super-market", "drive front if no obstacle in front of me" . 

This code is not yet made, the LaTeX document is not done.
